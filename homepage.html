                <h3> About US </h3>
                <p> Farmerce is founded in 2021 by a group of passionate volunteers who share the same dedication of helping BC farmers and restaurant during Covid-19 pandemic. </p>
            
                <p> Due to covid-19, global chains broke. Canada used to export vegetables/crops/potatoes, but now the report shows tones of potatoes/crops have nowhere to go and are rotting in the field.

                    Also due to this pandemic, restaurant owners are suffering. To help them recover from their financial loss, it would be helpful to provide a method  reducing  the cost of food supply.
                    
                    If restaurant owners directly purchase the products from local farms, the cost would be reduced ( as the middle store such “Whole Food” , won’t take profits in between) . </p>
