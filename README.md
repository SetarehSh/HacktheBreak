Due to COVID-19, global chains broke. Canadian suppliers used to export produce, but [now reports shows tons of them have nowhere to go and are thus going to waste](https://globalnews.ca/news/6870689/coronavirus-canada-food-supply/). Also due to this pandemic, restaurants (including major chains such as Earls and Cactus Club) lost revenue due to more people staying at home. In worse cases, some of those restaurants were forced shut down. Notable ones include The Pear Tree, Royal Dinette, and Ki Cafe.

To help them recover from their financial loss, it would be helpful to provide a method to reduce the cost of the food supply. If restaurant owners and head chefs directly purchase the products from local suppliers over (say) Sysco or Gordon Food Services (the "big two" suppliers for restaurants), it would be cheaper.
